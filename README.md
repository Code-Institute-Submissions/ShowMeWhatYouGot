# **Show Me What You Got!**

[Show Me What you got!](https://bicks79.github.io/ShowMeWhatYouGot/) is a memory puzzle game based on the [Adult Swim](https://www.adultswim.com/) animated TV show [Rick and Morty](https://www.rickandmorty.com/).
It is the second of four major projects to be undertaken on the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Developer software course.
The purpose of this project is to combine my experience of front end programming languages and produce a fully interactive site that demonstrates my knowledge and understanding of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).


## **UX**
The purpose of the project is to create a fully interactive website/application using front end programming languages.
As a gamer, I decided to build a memory based puzzle game as I thought this would offer the most interactivity.
With this in mind, I started to ask myself questions about the project:

### **User Stories**
 - As a user, I want something fun to play.
 - As a user, I want to play something easy.
 - As a user, I want to be challenged.
 - As a user, I want to play something relatable.
 - As a user, I want to play something on my daily commute.
 - As a user, I want to play something different.
 - As a user, I want to know what options are available.
 - As a user, how do I play the game.
 - As a user, can I turn the audio on/off.
 - As a user, when do I know if I've won the game.
 - As a user, can I play again.
 - As a user, can I give up.
 - As a user, can I navigate my way through the game easily.

 These user stories became the building blocks for my project and helped me to understand what sort of game I should build that would best suit the brief.
 The game needed to be fun to play and keep the user involved at all times.  It needed to suit the users skill level and give them the option to select a game that they felt would be easy to play, or more challenging.
 Making the game relatable to the user was also a key requirement, which is why I opted for the content and theming based around [Rick and Morty](https://www.rickandmorty.com/). It has a large varied fan base, and had a huge amount of online content for me to utilise.

 I always had an idea of what I wanted the game to look like, what sort of memory game it could be, and the syle in which it would play.
 I drew out some initial sketches of what I would like to include in the game and how the layout of thesite would look.
