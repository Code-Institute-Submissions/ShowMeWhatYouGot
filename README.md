# **Show Me What You Got!**

[Show Me What you got!](https://bicks79.github.io/ShowMeWhatYouGot/) is a memory puzzle game based on the [Adult Swim](https://www.adultswim.com/) animated TV show [Rick and Morty](https://www.rickandmorty.com/).
It is the second of four major projects to be undertaken on the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Developer software course.
The purpose of this project is to combine my experience of front end programming languages and produce a fully interactive site that demonstrates my knowledge and understanding of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).


## **UX**
The purpose of the project is to create a fully interactive website/application using front end programming languages.
As a gamer, I decided to build a memory based puzzle game as I thought this would offer the most interactivity.
I started to ask myself questions about my project:

### **User Stories**
 - As a user, I want something fun to play.
 - As a user, I want to play something easy.
